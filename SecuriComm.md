Our conversation has covered several key areas:

Product Requirements Document (PRD): We started by creating a comprehensive PRD for the SecuriComm application, detailing its vision, features, user experience, technical specifications, timeline, and success criteria.
PRD Export: You then requested to bundle this PRD into a clickable, downloadable PDF.
App Description: I provided a description of the SecuriComm app, highlighting its military-grade security, AI-powered threat detection, and zero-trust architecture.
Web Application Development: Following that, I developed a complete, responsive HTML web application for SecuriComm, including a detailed download section for various development environments (CLI, Cursor IDE, Qodo Gen, Augment Code), along with installation instructions and security features like SHA-256 checksums.
Dependency Error: Most recently, you encountered an npm install error related to expo-local-authentication@~14.1.1, indicating that no matching version was found.
