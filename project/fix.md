# Codebase Analysis and Fixes

After analyzing the `package.json` file, I've identified several issues that need to be addressed. Here's a summary of the problems and my plan to fix them:

### 1. Outdated Dependencies

Many dependencies are outdated, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

**Fix:** I will update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.

### 2. Inconsistent Dependency Versions

Some dependencies have inconsistent versions, which can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

**Fix:** I will ensure all dependencies have consistent and compatible versions.

### 3. Missing `engines` Field

The `package.json` file is missing an `engines` field, which specifies the Node.js version required for the project. This can lead to issues when deploying or running the project in different environments.

**Fix:** I will add an `engines` field to specify the required Node.js version.

### 4. Unused Dependencies

There may be unused dependencies in the project, which can increase the bundle size and slow down the installation process.

**Fix:** I will remove any unused dependencies.

### 5. Missing `resolutions` Field

The `package.json` file is missing a `resolutions` field, which can be used to enforce specific versions of dependencies and avoid conflicts.

**Fix:** I will add a `resolutions` field to enforce consistent dependency versions.

I will now proceed with these fixes.
